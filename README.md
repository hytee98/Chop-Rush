To me an 'unknown product" is one that exists but has not reached the right audience yet. Chop Rush is a food delivery\hyper local app that connects users with meals already being prepared nearby. 
Traditional delivery wait until an order is placed to start cooking, Chop rush lists ready or nearly ready dishes
from local vendors, reducing wait times, lowering waste, and increasing vendor revenue.
Problem: Busy people face long delivery waits and decision fatigue; local vendors often have surplus prepared food with low visibility.
Solution: By showing "ready now" meals and short ETA options, Chop rush connects customer who wants fopod fast with vendors who have meals ready to go turning overlooked opportunities into immediate orders. 
This reframing turns an existing product category into an "unknown" innovation through real time readiness.
Main Features:
- Live meal feed
- Fast delivery
- Vendor dashboard
- This Project helped me understand how to describe a product, plan features and think about user problems.
