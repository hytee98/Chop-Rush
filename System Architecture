2. **Backend:** 
   - Developed using Node.js 
   - Handles authentication, order management, payment processing, and communication between users, restaurants, and riders through RESTful APIs.

3. **Database:**
   - MYSQL stores user data, menus, restaurant information, and order details.

4. **Paypal Payment:**
   - Integrated with Paypal for securing online payment.

**Communication Flow:**
- Customers place orders through the frontend.
